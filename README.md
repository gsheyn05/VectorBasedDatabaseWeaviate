Quick Little Attempt working with Vector Based Database Weaviate

Most code is similar to the tutorial linked here (https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/quickstart/end-to-end)

With data used from there mock json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weaviate-tutorials/quickstart/main/data/jeopardy_tiny.json

I did add user input for searching the vector database for Word Similarity instead of just searching for biology
